Introduction
============

This demo is:

- Proof of concept for mr.migrator: A tool that provides the ability to
  register and execute collective.transmogrifier pipelines without creating a
  Python package. It's Miller Time™.

- Also proof of concept for collective.transmogrifier with the CMFCore
  dependency removed (and a zope.component dependency added in its place).
  It's Scotch time™.
